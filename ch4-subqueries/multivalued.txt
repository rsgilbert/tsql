A multivalued subquery is a subquery that returns 
multiple values as a single column. 

// return orders placed by employees whose lastname start with D 
SELECT orderid, empid 
FROM Sales.Orders 
WHERE empid IN (SELECT E.empid FROM HR.Employees AS E WHERE E.lastname LIKE '%D%')
ORDER BY empid DESC ;

// orders by USA employees 
SELECT orderid, empid 
FROM Sales.Orders 
WHERE empid IN (SELECT E.empid FROM HR.Employees AS E WHERE E.country = 'USA')
ORDER BY empid DESC ;

// Customers who did not place any orders 
SELECT * 
FROM Sales.Customers 
WHERE custid NOT IN (SELECT custid FROM Sales.Orders);


// preparation 
CREATE TABLE dbo.Orders(orderid INT NOT NULL CONSTRAINT PK_Orders PRIMARY KEY);

INSERT INTO dbo.Orders (orderid) 
    SELECT orderid 
    FROM Sales.Orders 
    WHERE orderid % 2 = 0;

SELECT * FROM dbo.Orders;

// select missing orders 
SELECT n 
FROM dbo.Nums 
WHERE 
    n NOT IN (SELECT * FROM dbo.Orders)
    AND 
    n BETWEEN 
        (SELECT MIN(orderid) FROM dbo.Orders)
        AND 
        (SELECT MAX(orderid) FROM dbo.Orders)
