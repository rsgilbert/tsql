// if there is ROW_NUMBER, the rows are all unique 
// below wont work
SELECT DISTINCT val, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY val) AS rownum 
FROM Sales.OrderValues

// this will work. We first group the data, then assign a row number for each group
SELECT val, ROW_NUMBER() OVER (ORDER BY val) AS rownum 
FROM Sales.OrderValues 
GROUP BY val;
